== Introduction

CServer (Collectd-Service) is a rails webapplication used for displaying submitted node stats

== Deployment
* Like any other rails app
* No SQL-database is needed.
* In database.yml: Set your collectd-Base-Directory
* Each Hostname is expected to start with a node-id (mac-address!) eg: 10feed2b1b36.nodes.kbu.freifunk.net
